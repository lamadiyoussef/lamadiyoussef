👋 Hi, I’m @lamadiyoussef  


👀 I’m interested in data engineering, focusing on building efficient ETL pipelines, and optimizing data workflows for scalable solutions. 

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python, machine learning, and Big data.  

👨‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to ETL pipelines, big data processing, and real-time data streaming.  

📫 How to reach me: yousseflamadi3@gmail.com or yousseflamadi7@gmail.com.  

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy exploring how data can tell stories that drive decision-making!
